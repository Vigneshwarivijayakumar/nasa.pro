        <span id="fou4"></span>
        <p id="word2">Previous missions to Mars have investigated <br>the surface history of the Red Planet by <br>examining features like canyons, volcanoes, <br>rocks and soil. However, signatures of the <br> planet's formation can only be found by sensing <br>and studying its "vital signs" far below the <br>surface.
        </p>
        <p id="word3">In comparison to the other terrestrial planets, <br> Mars is neither too big nor too small. This <br>means that it preserves the record of its <br>formation and can give us insight into how the <br>terrestrial planets formed. It is the perfect <br> laboratory from which to study the formation <br>and evolution of rocky planets. Scientists know <br>that Mars has low levels of geological activity. <br>But a lander like InSight can also reveal just <br>how active Mars really is.</p>
